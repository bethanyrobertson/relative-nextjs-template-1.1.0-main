  'about-bethany.md': `# About Bethany

## My Design Journey
I discovered my passion for design through a unique path that started with printmaking in undergrad. After majoring in printmaking, I taught high school art for a year while earning my MS in art education. This was followed by a move to New Jersey to pursue my MFA at Rutgers University. Since then, I've taught at several institutions including the 92nd Street Y, all while working as a designer.

My journey has evolved from visual arts to bridging visual identity with product strategy and now technical implementation - a combination that gives me a unique perspective on creating meaningful digital experiences.

## Design Philosophy & Approach
"Great design is invisible - it solves problems so elegantly that users don't have to think about it. I believe in designing with empathy, testing with real users, and building with accessibility in mind from day one."

My approach always starts with understanding the user's real needs, not just what they say they want. I combine qualitative research with quantitative data to create solutions that are both human-centered and business-viable.

## Core Values & Interests
- **Accessibility First:** I'm passionate about creating inclusive digital experiences that work for everyone, regardless of ability
- **Mentorship:** I regularly mentor aspiring designers through ADPList and speak at design meetups
- **Continuous Learning:** I stay current with emerging design tools, technologies, and methodologies
- **Sustainable Design:** I advocate for sustainable design practices and digital minimalism

## Beyond Design
When I'm not designing, you'll find me:
- Creating illustrations and exploring my artistic roots
- Baking delicious treats and crafting cocktails
- Traveling to amazing places (Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal are favorites)
- Spending quality time with my partner and our dog Mochi
- Watching documentary films
- Learning to knit (always expanding my creative skills)
